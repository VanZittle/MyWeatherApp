MyWeatherApp

This is an app that anyone can reach out to check on weather forecast by adding any city of their interest. The user can get real-time, accurate weather information as well as the next 5 days data. To develop this challenge, I reached out to previous activities during the course, the API weather documentation, the recommended blog in the instructions of the challenge, stackoverflow to display the day names, and W3Schools to know how to display the date.

## User story

AS A user who wants to know the weather in any city of the world,
I WANT a weather forecast app
SO THAT I can showcase real-time weather as well as forecast for the next 5 days.

## Acceptance criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
* WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
